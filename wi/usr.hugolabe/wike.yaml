# Highly relevant packages like this one are added by Konbini itself and not their owners, in an attempt to bootstrap our store.

# If you own this package, simply make a PR removing this comment and modifying this manifest to your liking, including package sources if needed.
# If you really wish to, you may remove it entirely as well (in which case you might want to delete your profile from KonbiniAuthors/usr.YOUR_USER.yaml).
