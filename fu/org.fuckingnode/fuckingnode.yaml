  **FuckingNode is a CLI tool that automates tasks and gives you tools to make JavaScript development less of a f*cking headache.** We can't fix your bugs, but we can automate most headache-giving tasks across all of your NodeJS/Deno/Bun projects and give you a set of tools to make JS development great again.\n## Features

  - automated cleanup of JS projects

  - automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for pnpm or Bun, where a single global cache exists)
  
  - automated updates of JS projects' dependencies
  
  - automated linting of JS projects
  
  - automated prettying of JS projects
  
  - automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)
  
  - automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code\n

  \- **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's FuckingNode-and that name is shipping to production.

  ## And there's more

  - automated release / update process of npm / jsr packages, from a single command
  
  - automated cloning of a repo, installation of dependencies, and opening of your favorite editor for a project, from a single command
  
  - automated cross-manager (e.g. npm -> pnpm) or cross-runtime (e.g. NodeJS/npm -> Bun) migration, from a single command
  
  - a security audit assistant that analyzes vulnerabilities and tells you if they do affect your project or can be safely ignored, from a single command
  
  - addition of a pre-configured tsconfig.json or .gitignore file for your project, from a single command
  
  - automated removal of entire node_modules across all of your projects for storage emergencies, from, you guessed it, a single command"
