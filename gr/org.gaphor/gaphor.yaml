slogan: Simple UML and SysML modeling tool
desc: "<p>\n      Gaphor is a UML, SysML, RAAML, and C4 modeling application. It is\n      designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements\n      a fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture\n      drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects\n      of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.\n    </p>\n      <p>\n      Gaphor provides four modeling languages: UML, SysML, RAAML and C4 and\n      makes them accessible to beginners.\n    </p>"
