desc: "<p>\n      KCachegrind is a profile data visualization tool, used to determine the most time consuming parts in the execution of a program.\n    </p>\n      <p>Features:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>KCachegrind visualizes profiles (i.e. runtime characteristics) of applications in various ways,\n          including call graph visualisations and source/disassembler annotation.</li>\n        <li>It can load profiles generated by the cache simulation/call tracer Calltree, a Valgrind tool.\n          Thus, profiling does not need any preparation, can cope with shared libraries and plugin architectures, and does not influence the measuring itself.</li>\n        <li>Converter scripts for OProfile, Perl, and PHP.</li>\n        <li>Switching between multiple visualization layouts.</li>\n        <li>Call graph can be exported as image (PNG).</li>\n        <li>Simultaneous display of 2 event types in Call and Annotation View</li>\n      </ul>"
