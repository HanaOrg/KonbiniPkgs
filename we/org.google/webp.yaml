slogan: "An image format for the Web."
desc: >
  WebP is a modern **image format** that provides superior **lossless and lossy** compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.

  WebP lossless images are [26% smaller](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study#results) in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are [25-34% smaller](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study) than comparable JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index.

  Lossless WebP **supports transparency** (also known as alpha channel) at a cost of just [22% additional bytes](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study#results). For cases when lossy RGB compression is acceptable, **lossy WebP also supports transparency**, typically providing 3Ã— smaller file sizes compared to PNG.

  Lossy, lossless and transparency are all supported in **animated WebP images**, which can provide reduced sizes compared to GIF and APNG.
