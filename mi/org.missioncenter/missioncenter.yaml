# Highly relevant packages like this one are added by Konbini itself and not their owners, in an attempt to bootstrap our store.
# This is shown in Konbini because of this bs flag:
bs: true
# If you own this package, simply make a PR removing this comment and modifying this manifest to your liking, including package sources if needed.
# If you really wish to, you may remove it entirely as well (in which case you might want to delete your profile from KonbiniAuthors/usr.YOUR_USER.yaml).

  Monitor your CPU, Memory, Disk, Network and GPU usage, accompanied by a per app and process breakdown of these statistics

  Features:

  - Monitor overall or per-thread CPU usage
  - See system process, thread, and handle count, uptime, clock speed (base and current), cache sizes
  - Monitor RAM and Swap usage
  - See a breakdown how the memory is being used by the system
  - Monitor Disk utilization and transfer rates
  - Monitor network utilization and transfer speeds
  - See network interface information such as network card name, connection type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), wireless speeds and frequency, hardware address, IP address
  - Monitor overall GPU usage, video encoder and decoder usage, memory usage and power consumption, powered by the popular NVTOP project
  - Monitor system fans
  - See a breakdown of resource usage by app and process
  - Supports a minified summary view for simple monitoring
  - Use hardware accelerated rendering for all the graphs in an effort to reduce CPU and overall resource usage
  - Uses GTK4 and Libadwaita
  - Written in Rust

  Limitations (there is ongoing work to overcome all of these):

  - Intel GPU monitoring is only supported for Broadwell and later GPUs; and does not support VRAM, power, or temperature monitoring
  - When using Linux Mint/Cinnamon, launched applications may not show up in the "Applications" section (Upstream issue: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/12015)
