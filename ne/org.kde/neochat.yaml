desc: "<p>NeoChat is a chat app that lets you take full advantage of the Matrix network. It provides you with a secure way to send text messages, videos and audio files to your family, colleagues and friends.</p>\n      <p>NeoChat aims to be a fully featured application for the Matrix specification. As such everything in the current stable specification with the notable exceptions of VoIP, threads and some aspects of End-to-End Encryption are supported. There are a few other smaller omissions due to the fact that the Matrix spec is constantly evolving but the aim remains to provide eventual support for the entire spec.</p>\n      <p>Due to the nature of the Matrix specification development NeoChat also supports numerous unstable features. Currently these are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Polls - MSC3381</li>\n        <li>Sticker Packs - MSC2545</li>\n        <li>Location Events - MSC3488</li>\n      </ul>"
